  * `-h` to adjust line height (provided by the [line height patch](https://tools.suckless.org/dmenu/patches/line-height/))
  * `-nbh` to adjust background colour for highlighted characters (highlight provided by the [highlight patch](https://tools.suckless.org/dmenu/patches/highlight), option `-nbh` is my own)
- Fonts used:
  * Iosevka Nerd Font Mono
  * JoyPixels (emoji)
